## About the project

- Why have I created this?
  - I was frustrated because every project that I wanted to create needed user authentication and authorization features before the "cool" features. So, why not create a microsservice with these "boring" features?
- Why not use a good framework that already have this features?
  - I'm not a huge fan of using frameworks to automate things at that level, I mean, yes they're useful, but some software values loose coupling more than ease of use of frameworks.
- Why use Go instead Node(Ruby, Python, Elixir...)?
  - An authentication and authorization app will receive a lot of requests, I thought that a compiled language will be more appropriated for this purpose. Go is the compiled language that I have most knowledge about.
- How do I use it?
  - It's project is not deployed on a cloud server or anything, it's a "boilerplate" that you can clone, edit the code, and use it as you want. And that's why the license is MIT and not GPL.
- Forks? Issues? PR's?
  - Just fork it. Send your issue. Will be reviewed, if it fits with the project will be accepted.
